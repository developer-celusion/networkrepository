# NetworkRepository

Simple wrapper on the top of URLSession

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

NetworkRepository is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'NetworkRepository'
```

## Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```ruby
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/developer-celusion/networkrepository.git", from: "1.1.0")
]
```
